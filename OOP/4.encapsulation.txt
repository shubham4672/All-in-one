1. What is Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is a mechanism through which we can warp the data members and member methods of a class in a single unit.

    > Declare the class variables as private to make it a single unit.

    > Declare the class methods as public so that we can access the variables.

    eg. A class is the best example of encapsulation.

2. Example of encapsulation
    Encapsulation is a combination of data hiding and abstraction.
        class Encap{
            private int value; // data hiding
            public void setValue(int x){ // data abstraction
                value=x;
            }
            public int getValue(){
                return value;
            }
        }
        public class JavaEncapsulation {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                Encap obj=new Encap();
                obj.setValue(199);
                System.out.println(obj.getValue());
            }
        }

3. Usage of encapsulation
    Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties' direct access to them.
