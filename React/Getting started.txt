React JSX rendering:
    In React, JSX (which stands for JavaScript XML) allows you to write HTML elements directly within JavaScript. When a JSX component is processed by React, it is first compiled into a JavaScript object representation. This object, often referred to as a "React element," describes the structure of the component, including the HTML elements, attributes, and children.

    React then uses this object to efficiently update the DOM. When the component is rendered, React compares the newly generated object with the previous one (using a process called "reconciliation"). Based on this comparison, React updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, ensuring efficient rendering.

    const reactElement=React.createElement(
        'a',
        {href: 'https://google.com', target: '_blank'},
        'click me to visit google',
    )
    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
        reactElement
    )
