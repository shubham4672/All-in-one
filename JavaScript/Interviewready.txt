Null and Undefined
    undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. On the other hand, null is an assignment value. Also, undefined and null are        two distinct types: undefined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.

- Statically typed language is where each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types. Example: C, C++, Java.
- Dynamically typed languages can receive different data types over time. In this all type checks are performed in a runtime, only when your program is executing.
  JavaScript is dynamically typed; variables in JS can receive different data types over time.

What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript? 
    == is known as the loose equality operator in JavaScript. It compares two values for equality after converting them to a common type, which is called type coercion. On the other hand, === is the strict equality operator, which compares both the value and the type without performing any type conversion.

    0 == false  // true
    0 === false // false

What is the purpose of the bind() method in JavaScript? Can you provide an example of how it might be used?
    The bind() method is essential when you want to ensure that the this context within a function remains consistent, even when the function is passed around or called in a different context.
    (in non-strict mode)
    const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    greet: function() {
        console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name);
    }
    };

    const greetFunction = person.greet;
    greetFunction(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is undefined

    const boundGreetFunction = person.greet.bind(person);
    boundGreetFunction(); // Outputs: Hello, my name is Alice

What is a closure in JavaScript? Can you explain how closures work with an example?
    A closure in JavaScript is a feature where an inner function has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—even after the outer function has finished executing. Closures allow the inner function to "remember" the environment in which it was created.

    function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "I'm an outer variable";

    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable);
    }

    return innerFunction;
    }

    const closureExample = outerFunction();
    closureExample(); // Outputs: I'm an outer variable

What are JavaScript promises, and how do they help with asynchronous operations? Can you provide an example of how to create and use a promise?
    Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

    Key Concepts:

    Pending: The initial state; neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully, resulting in a value.
    Rejected: The operation failed, resulting in an error.

    const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Promise resolved");
        resolve("Success"); // Resolves the promise with a value
    }, 2000);
    });

    myPromise
    .then((result) => {
        console.log("Result:", result); // Handles the resolved value
    })
    .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Error:", error); // Handles any errors
    });

What is the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript? How would you use them appropriately in your code?
    null and undefined are both primitive values in JavaScript, but they serve different purposes:

    null:
        Definition: null is a special value that explicitly represents the absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable is intended to hold an object but does not currently hold any value.
        Type: The typeof null returns "object", which is a historical bug in JavaScript but is kept for backward compatibility.

    undefined:
        Definition: undefined is the value assigned to variables that have been declared but not yet initialized. It also represents the absence of a value in the context of a function’s return value if no explicit return is provided.
        Type: The typeof undefined returns "undefined".

What are JavaScript closures, and how do they differ from JavaScript callbacks? Can you provide an example illustrating the difference between the two?
    Closures:

    Definition: A closure is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function retains access to variables and parameters of its outer function even after the outer function has finished executing.
    Purpose: Closures are used to create private variables, manage state, and encapsulate functionality.

    Callbacks:
    Definition: Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed later, usually in response to an event or as part of an asynchronous operation. They are used to handle results or perform actions once a specific task is completed.

What is event delegation?
    Definition: Event delegation is a technique where a single event listener is added to a parent element rather than attaching individual listeners to each child element. This approach leverages event bubbling to handle events for multiple child elements efficiently.

    const itemList = document.getElementById("itemList");

    itemList.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    if (event.target.tagName === "LI") { // Check if the clicked element is an <li>
        event.target.style.color = "blue"; // Change color of the clicked item
    }
    });

What is the purpose of the this keyword in JavaScript, and how does its value differ in various contexts (e.g., global scope, object methods, event handlers)?
    this refers to the object calling the method. In a global context (outside of any function or object), this refers to the global object (window in browsers, global in Node.js). Inside a regular function, this refers to the global object in non-strict mode but is undefined in strict mode.In an event handler, this typically refers to the DOM element that triggered the event.

    > console.log(this); // In a browser, this refers to the window object.
    > const myObj = {
            name: "user",
            greeting: function() {
                console.log(`Hello ${this.name}`); // Refers to myObj
            }
        };
        myObj.greeting(); // Output: Hello user
    > function showThis() {
        console.log(this); // Refers to the global object
        }
        showThis();
    > const arrowFunction = () => {
        console.log(this); // Refers to the lexical context (i.e., where the arrow function is defined)
    };
    arrowFunction(); // Refers to the global object if defined in the global scope
    > document.querySelector("button").addEventListener("click", function() {
        console.log(this); // Refers to the button element
    });

What are higher-order functions in JavaScript? How are they useful, and can you provide examples of common higher-order functions?
    A higher-order function is a function that either:

    > Takes one or more functions as arguments.
        function greet(name) {
            return `Hello, ${name}!`;
        }

        function processUser(name, callback) {
            // callback is a function passed as an argument
            return callback(name);
        }
        console.log(processUser('Alice', greet)); // Output: Hello, Alice!

    > Returns a function as its result.
        function multiplyBy(factor) {
            // Returns a new function that multiplies its input by the factor
            return function (number) {
                return number * factor;
            };
        }
        const double = multiplyBy(2);
        console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10


    eg. map, reduce, filter

What is a Prototype in JavaScript?
    Prototype: In JavaScript, every object has a special internal property called [[Prototype]]. This prototype object is used to inherit properties and methods from another object. The prototype mechanism enables JavaScript to support inheritance and share behavior across different objects.

    // Define a prototype object
    const personPrototype = {
        greet() {
            console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
        }
    };

    // Create a new object with personPrototype as its prototype
    const john = Object.create(personPrototype);
    john.name = 'John Doe';

    // Access method from the prototype
    john.greet(); // Output: Hello, John Doe

    // Add a new property directly to john
    john.age = 30;
    console.log(john.age); // Output: 30

    // The greet method is inherited from the prototype, but age is unique to john


What are JavaScript's prototypal inheritance and how does it differ from classical inheritance? Can you provide an example to illustrate how prototypal inheritance works?
    Prototypal inheritance is a feature of JavaScript where objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has an internal property called [[Prototype]] that points to another object. This prototype object can be used to share properties and methods among objects.

    How It Differs from Classical Inheritance:

    Classical Inheritance: Often found in languages like Java, where classes are used to create objects and inheritance is achieved through class hierarchies.
    Prototypal Inheritance: In JavaScript, objects inherit directly from other objects. You don't need to define a class; you can create and link objects directly.
